#Stock Market Price Predictor

A machine learning web application built with Python that predicts stock market prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This end-to-end ML project fetches historical stock data and uses deep learning to forecast future stock prices.

üéØ Project Overview


This project creates a neural network capable of handling time series data to predict stock market prices based on historical trends. The application features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to analyze any stock by entering its ticker symbol.
